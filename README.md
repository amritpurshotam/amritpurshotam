## Hi there 👋

My name is Amrit Purshotam and I'm a machine learning engineer.

### 🛠️ What I'm building

Here are some personal projects that I work on in my spare time. Admittedly, most of these are still in their early stages of development.
 * **Computer Vision Papers**: Reproduction of the papers that won the ImageNet challenge since 2012.
 * **DeepSARA**: A revisit of my MSc project where I built classification models for southern African rock art figures but this time using the latest approaches.
 * **MLOps Workflow**: Experimenting on a DS workflow that utilises various MLOps tooling and best practices to build a project where all code, data, results, and artifacts are versioned together, reproducible from any point in the project history, and can be easily shared for comment and review.
 * **park2vec**: An attempt to train general location vectors with the aim to use them to build a parkrun course similarity tool.
