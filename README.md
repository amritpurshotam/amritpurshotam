## Hi there 👋

My name is Amrit Purshotam and I'm a machine learning engineer.

### 🛠️ What I'm building

Here's some of my personal projects that I'm currently working on.
 * **Computer Vision Papers**: Reproduction of the papers that won the ImageNet challenge since 2012.
 * **DeepSARA**: A revisit of my MSc project where I built classification models for southern African rock art figures but this time using the latest approaches.
 * **MLOps Workflow**: Experimenting on a DS workflow that utilises various MLOps tooling and best practices to build a project on a toy problem where all code, data, results, and artifacts are versioned together, reproducible from any point in the project history, and can be easily shared for comment and review.
 * **park2vec**: An attempt to train general location vectors with OpenStreetMaps but focus on parkrun locations around the world.
