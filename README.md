## Hi there 👋

My name is Amrit Purshotam and I'm a machine learning engineer. I'm from South Africa, living in Amsterdam, and currently working at ING.

### 🚶 My Journey

I studied Computer Science at university and eventually graduated with a Masters where I worked on object recognition and classification problems. From there, I moved into software engineering and worked primarily in the financial services sector. Wanting to move back to machine learning, I transitioned to a data science role and have worked on a much wider range of problems relating to vehicle telematics, health & wellness, and logistics.

### 🛠️ What I'm building

These are just some of personal projects that I work on in my spare time to improve my skills. Admittedly, these projects are still in their early stages.
 * **Computer Vision Papers**: My ambition is to eventually become a research engineer so I decided to combine that goal with my interest in computer vision. In this project then, I'm implementing the papers that won the ImageNet challenge over the years and reproducing the results.
 * **DeepSARA**: The state of the art of computer vision has come a long way in the years since I completed my MSc where I worked on recognising and classifying objects in southern African rock art. I'm curious to see just how much the latest approaches will improve on the results I previously obtained. I'm currently working on annotating a new dataset.
 * **MLOps Workflow**: The problem of versioning (code, data, models, results, and infrastructure) in data science projects is becoming more well understood with new tooling coming out that aims to solve this. I've found that, in practice, that the tools sometimes get in the way and I find myself fiddling more with the tool than trying to solve the problem at hand. In this project, I'm testing out a new workflow that combines DVC, GitHub Actions, W&B, Terraform, and GCP while abstracting away and/or automating the details.
