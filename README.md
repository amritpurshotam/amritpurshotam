## üëã Hi there

My name is Amrit Purshotam and I'm a machine learning engineer.

### üõ†Ô∏è What I'm building

Here are some personal projects that I work on in my spare time.
 * **[ImageNet Papers](https://github.com/amritpurshotam/computer-vision-papers)**: I'm implementing the best performing architectures from every year of the ImageNet challenge since 2012 as an exercise in reproduction and to step through time to see how the approaches evolved first-hand. What I'm doing differently here is implementing the architecture with the full training pipeline and making the [training runs](https://wandb.ai/amrit/computer-vision-papers) public with `wandb`.
 * **[FancyPCA](https://github.com/amritpurshotam/fancypca)**: I built a demo of the [PCA Colour Augmentation](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2012/file/c399862d3b9d6b76c8436e924a68c45b-Paper.pdf#page=5) technique with Streamlit which can be seen live [here](https://share.streamlit.io/amritpurshotam/fancypca).
 * **[Baobab](https://github.com/deep-learning-indaba/Baobab/)**: I'm helping to build an event management platform that enables grass-roots community builders to scale their efforts when organising conferences that have more complex logistics around the selection of attendees. The application is primarily built for and used by the [Deep Learning Indaba](https://deeplearningindaba.com/) who I am a passionate supporter of and is my way of giving back. 

I'm also currently incubating the below projects while I figure out some final details before getting started in earnest.
 * **DeepSARA**: A revisit of my MSc project where I built classification and detection models for [southern African rock art](http://www.sarada.co.za/#/library/) figures using classical ML and CV techniques. I'm now curious to see well some deep learning approaches work.
 * **park2vec**: I want to train general [location vectors](https://www.sentiance.com/2018/05/03/venue-mapping/) with the aim to use them to build a [parkrun](https://www.parkrun.com/) course similarity tool.
